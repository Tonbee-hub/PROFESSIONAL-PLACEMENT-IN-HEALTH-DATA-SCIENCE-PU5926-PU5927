## PROJECT TITLE
Uncovering Nutritional Insight Through Cancer Card User Analytics

## BACKGROUND/CONTEXT
Nutrition remains a vital yet often overlooked aspect of cancer support. Patients, survivors, and caregivers frequently seek dietary advice to manage side effects, preserve strength, and enhance quality of life. Nonetheless, these needs are often overshadowed by pressing clinical issues, and many support services find it challenging to incorporate them into a structured, data-driven framework.
During discussions with Cancer Card, it was evident that nutrition was a common concern among users. However, there was no structured data to confirm, measure, or address this need. Specifically, there was no user-level data regarding nutrition searches, preferences, or confidence in dietary management. Consequently, the project could not move forward as a straightforward data analysis effort.
Rather than seeing this as a limitation, I viewed it as a design opportunity, an innovative way to showcase potential outcomes if appropriate data collection and analytics systems were implemented.

## PROJECT AIMS
The project aimed to:
•	Create a practical simulation illustrating how Cancer Card could start gathering, analysing, and utilising nutrition insights using data science techniques.

## METHODS USED AND RESULTS 
Survey Design (Google Forms)  
I created a carefully structured nutrition-focused user survey, aligned with established evidence on cancer-related nutrition needs. The survey captured:  
•	Relationship to cancer    
•	Search for nutrition-related information  
•	Nutrition-related topics of interest  
•	Preferred content format  
•	Self-rated confidence in managing nutrition  
• comment
